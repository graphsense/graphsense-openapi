# GraphSense OpenAPI specification (DEPRECATED)

The OpenAPI Spec is now directly maintained in the [graphsense-REST](https://github.com/graphsense/graphsense-REST/blob/0e8e1aa1261f3580e98ed22e900ba4d6e299be4b/openapi_spec/graphsense.yaml) repository.

This repository contains the OpenAPI specification for the
[GraphSense](https://www.graphsense.info) API.

This is intended to be used for client generation with a self-hosted
[setup](/graphsense/graphsense-setup). So you need to update `servers` in
`graphsense.yaml` to meet your deployment.

See [OpenAPI Generators](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators) for a
list of possible clients.
